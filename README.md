# Project Alpha

Welcome to the ground floor of Project Alpha!
So far, this game will be a true test of craftmanship using web technologies!

## Current Version: v0.0.1

- First iteration of the map gen system ( /map )
- Concept for class state ( /entity )
- Very basic combat loop: baisc loop with delays ( /combat )

## Planned Features:

- Map tile system: random gen
- Turn based combat system
- Questing
- Pixel art design
- OOP random gen for weapons/enemies
- Inventory system
- Sound effects/Combat Sounds

## Requirements

This project requires a classic MERN setup to use efficiently.
Make sure MongoDB is installed to make use of the backend tools.
Pulling node_modules is needed to get all required dependencies.
Run this in terminal on both ./client and ./server folders:

```
npm install
```

# Getting Started
